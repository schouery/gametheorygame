%p.title Creating Two Player Matrix Games
%p
  A Two Player Matrix Games is a game with two players where the set of strategies are finite and the payoffs
  are given by a matrix. 
%p
  You can create a new Two Player Matrix Game by clicking in
  %strong New Two Players Matrix Game
  in the
  %strong Games
  page.
  
%p  
  You will be presented with a page that contains some fields. You should enter the name of the game, it's
  description, the number of the players and the color (remember: red are games with negative payoff, green with
  positive payoff and yellow games that have positive and negative payoffs).
%p
  You will see a matrix on the bottom of the page. You will see four big fields (on the first column and the
  first line) and eight smaller fields on the middle. The big fields are the strategies labels for each
  column and line and the smaller fields are the payoff for the players. You should note that, in a specific
  pair of line and column strategy you have two smaller fields. The left most is the payoff of the column
  player and the right most is the payoff of line player. You can add more lines or columns by clicking in
  %strong Add.
  
%p.title Creating Symmetric Function Games
%p
  A Symmetric Function Game is a game where all player have the same finite set of strategies and the payoff
  is given by a function equal to all users.

%p  
  You can create a new Symmetric Function Game by clicking in
  %strong New Symmetric Function Game
  in the
  %strong Games
  page.

%p  
  You will be presented with a page that contains some fields. You should enter the name of the game, it's
  description, the number of the players and the color (remember: red are games with negative payoff, green with
  positive payoff and yellow games that have positive and negative payoffs). You should put a label on the
  first and second strategy and you can add more strategy by clicking in
  %strong Add Strategy.

%p  
  At least, you should put a valid Ruby code in the function field. You can use two predefined arrays: np and
  st. np[i] indicates the number of players that chosen the strategy i and st[i] is one if the player
  has chosen the strategy i and zero otherwise. You should note that the strategies indexes starts at 0.

  %strong Statistics
  in the

  page or in a specific game page, you will see the statistics for this game. 
%p  
  If it is a Symmetric Function
  Game, then you will see the percentage of times that the users chosen a specific strategy when playing this
  game.
%p
  If it is a Two Player Matrix Game, then you will see a matrix where each cell informs you of the percentage
  of time that a result occurred.
